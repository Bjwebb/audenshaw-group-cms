********** Update **********

I am not longer actively working on the cms, and this particular
branch of the code is no longer in use anywhere, http://adfa.co.nr/
now uses mediawiki. ALthough I doubt it, if anyone does find any use
for my code, please let me know by e-mail and msn: bjwebb67@googlemail.com
or on irc.freenode.net as user bjwebb. I would be happy if anyone finds
any use for it, so, if you ask, I will let you use it under any terms.
